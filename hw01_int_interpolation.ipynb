    "**Background.** We discussed numerical integration with the trapezoidal scheme and the errors associated with it. Notebook <tt>02_integration_approximation.ipynb</tt> contains routines that compute the luminosity distance $d_L$ using trapezoidal scheme, as well as Romberg method implemented in the SciPy's integration routine <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.romberg.html\"><tt>scipy.integrate.romberg</tt></a>. This routine that uses my trapezoidal routine is reproduced at the bottom of this notebook. In this exercise, I would like you to replace my routine implementing trapezoidal scheme with your own routine that estimates the integral to the 4th order of accuracy (i.e., fractional error scaling as $\\propto h^4$, where $h$ is step size used) using the trick of elimination of the leading error term.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, your routine should implement computation of $R_1(h) = [4T(h/2)-T(h)]/3$, where $T(h)$ and $T(h/2)$ are integral estimates with the trapezoidal schem with step sizes $h$ and $h/2$, respectively. This is actually done in my routine <tt>trapzd2</tt> in the <tt>02_integration_approximation.ipynb</tt> notebook, but in there it is done in a computationally inefficient way. Namely, when it computes $T(h/2)$ via a call to <tt>trapzd</tt> it does the same work as in computation of $T(h)$, because half of the points at which $f(x)$ is evaluated in $T(h/2)$ are the same as in the calculation of $T(h)$. The routine you implement in this exercise should avoid this redundancy. The note below explains how do this.\n"
