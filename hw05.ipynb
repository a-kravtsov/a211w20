    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will redo the analysis you did in homework 3 using supernovae to constrain model parameters but with a different approach. There are two differences in the approach you will use in this exercise: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) you will work with the *likelihood function* instead of $\\chi^2$. The likelihood function and the rationale for its use, as well as relation of $\\chi^2$ to this function were introduced in the lab and you can find the description in <a href=\"07_model_parameter_inference.ipynb\"><tt>07_model_parameter_inference.ipynb</tt></a> notebook. More precisely, you will work with the likelihood function and prior probability distributions for model parameters, which combined give the pdf called *posterior distribution function*. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) you will use the model that abandons assumption that supernovae type Ia are \"standard candles\" (i.e. have the same absolute magnitude value $M_0$). Instead, the absolute magnitude of each supernova will be corrected using two of its properties measured in observations. This requires two additional parameters, which brings the number of model parameters from 3 to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have to map out the likelihood in 5-dimensional model parameter space, which cannot be easily done by sampling on a grid as could be done for 3D parameter space in homework 3. Thus, in the two exercises in this homework you will first find the \"best fit\" model parameters in the first exercise and then will learn how to estimate uncertainties by sampling 5-dimensional posterior distribution.

    "The model described in <a href=\"hw03.ipynb\"><tt>hw03.ipynb</tt></a> has 3 parameters: $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda$, $\\tilde{M_0}$ and predicts the difference between observed and model distance modulus to be: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\Delta\\mu=\\mu_{\\rm obs} - \\mu(z,\\Omega_{\\rm m0},\\Omega_\\Lambda) &=&m_{\\rm SNIa} - M_0 - 5\\log_{10}\\tilde{d}_L(z,\\Omega_{\\rm m0},\\Omega_\\Lambda) - 5\\log_{10}c + 5\\log_{10}H_0 - 25\\\\\n",
    "&=& m_{\\rm SNIa} - 5\\log_{10}\\tilde{d}_L(z,\\Omega_{\\rm m0},\\Omega_\\Lambda) - \\tilde{M}_0, \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{M}_0 = \\left(M_0 + 5\\log_{10}\\,\\frac{c}{H_0}+25\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model assumes that the same absolute magnitude, $M_0$ (a measure of intrinsic supernova luminosity), is the same for all supernova. Objects for which this is true are called \"standard candles\" in astronomy. This is not a bad assumption. For decades astronomers did think that supernovae type Ia are standard candles. However, about 30 years ago it was shown that this is not quite true. Intrinsic absolute magnitude of supernovae of this type varies, but the variation occurs not randomly, but systematically as a function of supernova color (difference of magnitudes in different bands) and the characteristic time it takes for a supernova brightness to fade from its peak brightness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these properties are observable and are characterized by the color parameter, $c$, related to supernova color at peak brightness and lightcurve stretch parameter, $x_1$. Astronomers found that the parameter nearly constant for all supernovae is not $M_0$ ($M_0$ varies), but the combination $M_0 - \\alpha x_1 + \\beta c$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters that are constant for all supernovae. $M_0$,  and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are *nuisance* parameters of the model and have to be estimated from the data itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can modify our model for the distance modulus by including these two extra parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta\\mu=\\mu_{\\rm obs} - \\mu(z,\\Omega_{\\rm m0},\\Omega_\\Lambda)= m_{\\rm SNIa} - 5\\log_{10}\\tilde{d}_L(z,\\Omega_{\\rm m0},\\Omega_\\Lambda) - \\tilde{M}_0 + \\alpha x_1 - \\beta c,$$ \n",
